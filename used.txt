pip install face_recognition
pip had to be upgraded
2 times python 10 and 11 were installed
uninstalled one of them
dlib and cmake had to be installed
nad in this order
cmake
dlib
face-recognition
and then dlib i got error that cant build wheel something and all
using yt and chat gpt i solved after trying 10000 times
mainly what i did is
downloaded some file from github that had binary for dlib
tried to run that in cmd
using pip install<path to file.whl>
when this didnt work
i just double clicked on the excecutable file in the zip folder that i downleaded n 
then when i tried in pycharm the packages got installed
git hub link for that =  https://github.com/davisking/dlib/releases
